<!-- high level notes -->
<!-- put a lot more context in here.  what are my learning objectives.  people need help focusing their energy.  where should they spend the most time.  when i'm reading a chapter, do i need to skim it, what are the big ideas that i should not leave without understanding.  is my goal to develop just a passing familiarity with the concepts introduced in a certain book.  should i have built the todo app in basic iOS before moving on? if i struggle on it, should I move to the objective C work which might fill in my gaps?  give high level time constraints, spend at least X time on section 1, but definitely don't spend more than Y time -->
<!-- I personally would like a higher level understanding of how iOS works.  for example, in web development, i dynamically create HTML which I send to the browser and it knows how to render that to the end user.  What's happening in iOS.  When I have some kind of web app backend, and I send the iOS client JSON, what exactly does iOS do with it, does it have some markup language it uses to "render" stuff to the screen? should I be sending it HTML?  Maybe you could write your own high level into that's like here's a basic flow of how a typical iOS app would work? -->
<!-- what should I do if I get stuck somewhere, is stackoverflow a good resource?  how do i debug? can i contact you? should i just skip stuff if i get stuck? -->
<!-- in general, this feels like a LOT of shit to get through.  how advanced does this prework get? do you want people to be doing pretty advanced stuff on their own and getting lost or frustrated?  this was a point avi/ashley raised to me and I think is very valid. -->

This list comes from keeping track of what has been useful and not useful from
the past few years of learning iOS on my own. I'm compiling this to be a sort
of reference guide for the students in my upcoming class at [The Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/iOScurriculum.html "Flatiron School iOS Curriculum").

There are also a ton of great video content from
[Stanford](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/coding-together-developing/id593208016
"Stanford iTunes U Link") and
[Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ios-development "Treehouse iOS
webpage") but their progression doesn't need anything like this guide. I HIGHLY recommend
the Stanford class.

The goal here is for a student to achieve gradually increasing layers of quality. I recommend going
through the guide in order following the beginner tutorials first. Once you've
completed all of the beginner tutorials then go through it again hitting the
intermediate, and then advanced items.

If you have questions on any of the material, or think one of the items linked
isn't the best representation of a topic, raise an issue! If you have additions
you'd like to add send me a pull request.

guide.


Basic iOS
=========

This will get you going to write super simple app. It's not going to look
pretty, but it'll work. After following the beginner tutorials you should be
able to make a super simple ToDo list app. Go ahead. Give it a try!

Objective-C
===========

Objective-C is the language of iOS and it is most likely pretty different than
what you've done before. To get started you just need a bit of knowledge of
Objective-C, but to really master iOS development you need to get a solid
understanding of the language. The best Rails developers are also the best Ruby
developers. The same is true in the Objective-C/iOS world.

Core Data
=========

Core Data is a persistent data store. It is not a database. This is seriously
one of the most confusing technologies in the iOS ecosystem, but it is
something *you must learn*. I the integrating with APIs section you'll learn
even more about Core Data and how to save both locally and sync up to the
cloud. Think about all of the apps you use. Most of them can be boiled to down
to displaying some data that is synced to a service.

Integrating with APIs and Social Media
=====================
Nothing exists in a vacuum. Apps are expected to share effortlessly and backup
to the cloud. The beginner section has some of the super simple stuff and is
all you really need to get started. Once you've figured out some of the built
<!-- what is helios? -->
in features of iOS and Helios, the intermediate section will show you how to
add custom sharing features as well as the basics of talking to custom APIs.

I'm purposefully exposing you to the native iOS SDK networking stack before
AFNetworking and the other libraries. It's *very* hard to debug problems with
the libraries if you don't understand the underlying technologies.

Core Location/MapKit
=============

One of the biggest reasons mobile is such an interesting platform is the
ability to use location information. Think how much worse your phone would be
without Google Maps, Yelp, Foursquare, etc. Integrating Core Location is
actually quite easy.

After you learn how to use CoreLocation you need to learn how to present that
data with MapKit. MapKit allows integrated maps into your app. The advanced
section gives you some resources to use Google Maps instead of Apple Maps for
your integrated map views. Google Maps has some interesting features such as
Street View support, but it's very much icing on the cake. Nobody will complain
if you just use the standard MapKit.

Customizing UIKit
===================
AutoLayout is the new way of defining how your layouts work based on different
rotations and screen sizes. You are lucky because you will learn AutoLayout from
the very beginning but sadly The Big Nerd Ranch book doesn't include information on AutoLayout because it's
an iOS 5 book. I've included supplementary AutoLayout tutorials because of the
lack of information in the Big Nerd Ranch book.

Learning how to customize your app's UI is what separates the good apps from
the great. Think about all of the apps you use. Do any of them use the standard
UI elements? Nope. I bet you barely know what the standard iOS controls look
like. If you're interested open up the settings or contacts app.

This is a huge topic and much of what you'll do has been done by others and
answered on StackOverflow. After you've read this information and have specific
questions search on StackOverflow for answers. Very rarely are you doing
something completely unique.

you've done on a computer.

Core Animation
==============
Core Animation allows you to access to graphics card to some awesome animations
and transformations without sacrificing speed. The graphics card was designed
to do this and it does a great job. With that great power comes great
responsibility though. iPhone and iPad users expect fluid animations.
Thankfully, many standard animations you are used to seeing are actually built
into the iOS SDK and are super easy to integrate.
